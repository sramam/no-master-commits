A simple node module to prevent commits to the master branch. Include in your pre-commit flow and profit.

# Why?

A small brick in the wall that allows automation of a git-flow/feature-branch git branching workflow. Both prevent commits directly to the master branch.

A lazy-dog developer like me will always forget and commit locally, and then scramble to make things right. This is a
tool to prevent making the mistake.

Also as an aid to the forget-ful developer, provides the
required help to self-correct without having to resort to google.
